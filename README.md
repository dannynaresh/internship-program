Overview
Cyber Bully Tweet Classifier is a machine learning-based tool for identifying and classifying tweets that have cyberbullying content. Through the application of sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods and machine learning algorithms, this project helps to foster a safer online world by detecting aggressive or offensive content in real-time.

Features
Identifies and classifies non-bullying vs. bullying tweets

Uses NLP text normalization preprocessing

Supports a variety of feature extraction methods such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT

Applies a range of machine learning and deep learning models

Offers performance measurement through typical classification metrics

Built for real-time integration with social media and moderation platforms

Preprocessing Techniques
In order to have clean and consistent input data, the following preprocessing is done:

URL removal

Mention (@username) removal

Hashtag (#topic) removal

Punctuation and digit removal

Text lowercasing

Feature Extraction Methods
TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)

Word Embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT

Sentiment Analysis (optional for better context)

Models Used
Logistic Regression

Naïve Bayes

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the model is measured using the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Use Cases
Real-time analysis of social media posts

Automated marking of offensive tweets

Integration with moderation software and reporting mechanisms

User behavior analysis for aggressive pattern discovery
Future Work
Increasing dataset diversity

Real-time implementation with API compliance

Multilingual support for worldwide usage

Integration with other social media sites
